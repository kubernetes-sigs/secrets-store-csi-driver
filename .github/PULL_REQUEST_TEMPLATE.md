**Is this a chart or deployment yaml update?**
If yes, please update the yamls in the [manifest_staging/](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver/tree/main/manifest_staging/) folder, where we host the staging charts and deployment yamls. All the yaml changes will then be promoted into the released charts folder with the next release. Please also add the new configurable values to the configuration [table](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver/tree/main/manifest_staging/charts/secrets-store-csi-driver#configuration).
